To run my code, call python neural_nets.py. The code will automatically train both MSE and cross entropy neural nets on all the training data, then output a csv file of the test data classifications using cross entropy. To get a validation error, uncomment the validation error test code at the bottom and use train_set/label_set to train the neural nets. These two sets are randomized 50000 data points so the remaining 10000 are reserved for validation. To generate the plots, set the flag boolean at the top of the code to True. Otherwise, empty plots will be generated.
